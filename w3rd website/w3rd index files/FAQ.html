 	<h3><font color="#00FFFF">»How long does it take to design a website?</font></h3>
    <p>We keep your schedule in mind when we take on your project. At the start of each project, we create a timeline. The most common delays typically come in the final stages of the project while waiting for content or images from the client.</p>
    <br />
    <h3><font color="#00FFFF">»How much do you charge for your services?</font></h3>
    <p>The costs associated with our services vary accoring to the scope of the project. A simple website with a few static pages typically costs around $300, whereas a website with several pages and custom images could cost anywhere between $500 and $3000. As the complexity of the site increases, so does the cost. Our print design services follow a similiar scale. Don't hesitate to contact us for a free quote. Currently, we're offering discounted pricing in exchange for the privledge of featuring your site in our Design Portfolio.</p>
<br/>
    <h3><font color="#00FFFF">»What if I do not like the Design?</font></h3>
   	<p> Before we create the website or print materials, we send you mock-up images. If you do not like the suggested design, we will consult with you as to what changes need to be made, then design a second mock-up for your consideration. Our goal is to create a website tailored to your specific needs.</p>
   	<p>&nbsp;</p>
   	<h3><font color="#00FFFF">»Who owns the website once the website design is completed?</font></h3>
        The website belongs to you - we send you a copy of the website on cd. This copy is for your retention and should you wish to use another web design or web hosting company - you are completely at liberty to take this copy to them for them to use.<h3>
        <br />
        
        <font color="#00FFFF">»Can you provide all our web design and hosting services?</font></h3>Yes - we are your one stop company to provide all your web services. No more - not knowing who to call if you have problems - we can register your domain name - design your website - provide your web hosting and arrange your email accounts for you.
